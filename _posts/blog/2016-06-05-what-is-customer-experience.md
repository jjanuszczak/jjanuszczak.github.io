*Customer Experience* (CX) is a term in great use amongst companies today as we all try to be customer centric: putting the customer at the center of everything we do. It's probably rising on it's own [hype cycle][hype-cycle], and as the term gets overused, it may pass through a *peak of inflated expectations*. However, it's not all hype as clearly we can easily find many examples of being product-centric, or even otherwise in business. If we are going to use the term productively (vs. just hype), we need to know exactly what customer experience is (and is not!). Specifically, how is customer experience different than:

* Customer service, or
* Business process design

## What is Customer Experience?
According to [wikipedia][cx-def]:

> Customer experience (CX) is the product of an interaction between an organization and a customer over the duration of their relationship. This interaction includes a customer's attraction, awareness, discovery, cultivation, advocacy and purchase and use of a service.

The key attributes of the above worth calling out:

* Based on **interactions**: it's based on the set of *all* points of contact, often referred to as *touchpoints*, between the customer and an organization.
* (Potentially) **long lasting**: customer experience is defined  and measured over the duration of a relationship between an individual and an organization.
* Occurs at **many levels**: it's not just transactional and/or rational. CX also occurs at the emotional, sensorial and physical levels. In fact, the emotional response is often a function of a customer's values.
* It's measured **by the customer** against their expectations across all the levels above.

**Customer experience is the sum total of all interactions a customer has with an organization**. This runs from a customer’s initial awareness or discovery of a company  through to the purchase and use of its products or services. Customer experience is created by the customer's values *and* the company providing the experience. This includes aspects of the entire organization: employees, processes, and facilities. It encompasses every aspect of the products and services offered: from its marketing, packaging, product and service features, useability, reliability, etc.

## How is this Different than Customer Service?
Unlike CX, customer service is the individual moments (or touchpoints) when employees are providing direct service to customers. Customer service is but a subset of customer experience. However, within the context of CX, we can see that customer service is an economic asset instead of an expense: these touch points are crucial to the lifetime relationships with customers. The return on investment on providing excpetional service justifies the cost of providing such service.

## How is this Related to Process Design?
Bruce Silver, an expert on business process and process design, defines a *process* as a sequence of activities in pursuit of a goal or result. In this context, an *activity* corresponds to an action - a bit of “work performed”.  It is an action performed repeatedly in the course of business. Each time an activity is performed it has a well-defined start and end. Like activities, business processes are also performed repeatedly on separate business transactions or requests[[1]][silver-process]. Business processes are often triggered by specific ustomer interations or touchpoints.

Process design is where all possible activity sequences leading from some initial state to some well defined end state is mapped along with decision points and events that control  branching between sequences of activities. In a thoroughly designed process, every instance of the process will follow some sequence of activities described by this process map. Whether explicitly mapped on paper/electronically, or implicitly defined by the common practices of an organization, this mapping is sometimes called an *orchestration* (of specific activities).

Business processes are designed and *implemented* so as to achieve certain business goals such as consistency, optimizing the efficiency of the resources used to execute the process, completing transactions and/or requests within a set period of time, or delivering aspects of customer experience *for the touchpoints that are spanned by the process*. Individual processes do not span *all* the touchpoints between a customer and a company.

CX starts from the customer's start point, their motivations and desired outcomes rather than the company's and includes accounting for emotion in the design. A given process will ignore the real starting point for the customer and their specific motivations. Instead, it starts at the point at which the customer makes a specific kind of request or a particular event occurs.

## How does this Impact Operations?
A large part of the company's core value creating processes are usually executed and managed by an operations team or teams (at least from the point of customer on-boarding to the fulfilment of the product or service promise). Senior management usually sets strategy which leads to specific goals. Operations management will design and implement processes in such a way as to meet the goals of the organization (technically, processes are designed to achieve *KPI* targets that correspond to these goals). Today, more than ever, these goals will include how we deliver and manage components of the overall customer experience. Business processes have to contribute appropriately to the kind of touchpoints we want with our customers in the context of the overall customer experience. Put another way, organizations will design customer experiences which will include various touch points with the organization. Business processes then need to be designed and implemented in such a way as to provide/support the touch points required for the overall customer experience that is sought, while meeting other performance goals.

However, as another process expert has noted: moving from a product or efficiency centric viewpoint to one that puts the customer and the totality of their experience front and center represents a transformational change on a large scale. Taken seriously, CX will require radical redesign of core business processes to provide interactions that fit the CX design. The company must literally present itself and behave differently[[2]][anatoly-digital].

## CX & The Insurance Industry

Since I work in insurance, I'd be remiss not to tie CX back to my own industry. Insurance is being disrupted. New players - mostly digital - are focusing on customer experience. Insurance is not going to be "fixed" by a better website or iPhone app. Insurance companies have traditionally been designed to sell and serve policies. We need to change that and redesign insurance companies around serving customers: providing an exceptional customer experience over the lifetime of the customer realtionship.
